PBKDF2

Stands for Password-based-Key-Derivative-Function, a successor of PBKDF1 and is used to implement a 
pseudorandom function, such as a cryptographic hash, cipher, or HMAC to the input password or 
passphrase along with a salt value and repeats the process many times to produce a derived key, 
which can then be used as a cryptographic key in subsequent operations.


HMAC

Stands for Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a specific construction for calculating 
a message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a 
secret cryptographic key. Any cryptographic hash function,may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; 
the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1 accordingly.
